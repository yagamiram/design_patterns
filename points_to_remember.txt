Points to remember when u are going to design an object model X [OOP question]

1. Don't immediately go and draw the boxes in the white board.
2. Ask questions to interviewer. Take your time to understand the design.
3. Find the methods for the design. If you can't find a method they you are doomed.
4. Do Evolutionary design; Don't over complixate. start in easiest lowest basic way then improve it.
5. Most of the designing needs to have interface or abstract class/boxes. Verify if it is needed from interviewer. Because the design 
   problem migh tnot need an interface or abstract
6. Use a design pattern to show off your skills
7. Check the scalability of your design.
